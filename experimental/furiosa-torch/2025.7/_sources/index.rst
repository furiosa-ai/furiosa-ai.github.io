FuriosaAI RNGD Extension for PyTorch
================================================================

FuriosaAI RNGD Extension for PyTorch offers a seamless integration with existing PyTorch workflows
as well as lower-level APIs for more advanced use cases, allowing you to leverage the power of
FuriosaAI's TCP (Tensor Contraction Processor) architecture.
FuriosaAI RNGD Extension for PyTorch consists of three main components: Furiosa-Torch, Furiosa-HAL, and Furiosa-LLR.

.. warning::

   FuriosaAI RNGD Extension for PyTorch is an alpha release and is not yet ready for production use.
   It is intended for testing and evaluation purposes only.
   The features and APIs described herein are subject to change in the future.

   .. grid-item-card:: HAL (Hardware Abstraction Layer)
      :link: furiosa_torch/hal/index
      :link-type: doc
      :columns: 6

      Furiosa-HAL is an extension that provides a hardware abstraction layer for FuriosaAIâ€™s hardware acceleration,
      enabling asynchronous execution of PyTorch models and I/O on FuriosaAI NPUs.

   .. grid-item-card:: Furiosa Low-level Runtime
      :link: furiosa_torch/lla/index
      :link-type: doc
      :columns: 6

      Furiosa-LLR is a low-level runtime that directly exposes low-level primitives
      of the Tensor-Contraction Processor (TCP) architecture.
